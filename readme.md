Secure Image Uploading Web Application
Overview
This project is a web application that allows users to securely upload, store, and manage image files. It includes user authentication, secure image upload with validation, encrypted storage, and a personal gallery for each user.
Security Features
User Authentication

Secure password handling using Django's authentication system with bcrypt
Custom password requirements: 12+ characters, upper/lowercase, numbers, special characters
Email verification for new accounts
Rate limiting on login attempts
Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
CSRF protection on all forms

Secure Image Upload

Comprehensive file validation:

MIME type checking using python-magic
Content verification with PIL/Pillow
Image dimension validation to prevent DoS attacks
File size limits (5MB max)


Sanitization of filenames and metadata
Random UUID-based filenames to prevent path traversal
Whitelisting of allowed image formats (.jpg, .png, .gif)

Secure Storage

AES-256-CBC encryption for all stored images
Separation of encrypted data and encryption keys
Secure key management (session-based in this demo, would use HSM or KMS in production)

Access Control

Users can only access their own images
Proper authorization checks on all image operations
HTTP security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

Secure Configuration

HTTPS enforcement
Secure cookie settings
HSTS implementation
Restrictive Content Security Policy

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
PostgreSQL (recommended) or MySQL
Virtual environment tool (virtualenv or venv)

Installation Steps

Clone the repository
bashgit clone <repository-url>
cd secure-image-app

Create a virtual environment
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Configure environment variables
Create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_random_key
DEBUG=False
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/dbname
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password

Run database migrations
bashpython manage.py migrate

Create a superuser
bashpython manage.py createsuperuser

Run the server
bashpython manage.py runserver

Core Technologies

Backend: Django (Python)
Database: PostgreSQL (recommended)
Authentication: Django Authentication System + Custom Extensions
Encryption: AES-256-CBC via Python Cryptography library
File Validation: python-magic, Pillow, custom validators
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

Development Decisions and Tradeoffs
Encryption Implementation
We chose AES-256-CBC for image encryption due to its security and efficiency balance. In a production environment, keys should be stored in a separate secure database or HSM.
Storage Strategy
We store encrypted image data directly in the database as binary fields. For a production system with many or large images, consider:

Storing encrypted images on a filesystem with proper permissions
Using a secure object storage service (like S3 with server-side encryption)
Implementing a dedicated secure file storage system

Session Management
In this implementation, encryption keys are stored in the session for simplicity. In a production environment:

Use a proper key management system (KMS)
Consider a hardware security module (HSM) for key protection
Implement a more robust key rotation and management strategy

Security Testing
The application includes security tests covering:

Authentication and authorization
CSRF protection
File upload validation
Access control enforcement
Password policy enforcement
Rate limiting

Potential Improvements

Advanced Encryption Features

Implement key rotation
Add per-user encryption keys
Use a proper key management system


Additional Authentication Security

Complete multi-factor authentication implementation
OAuth integration for third-party login


Enhanced Image Protection

Add watermarking capabilities
Implement download restrictions
Add image metadata stripping


Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive security event logging
Intrusion detection system
Real-time security alerts


Performance Optimizations

Image caching for faster retrieval
Thumbnail generation for gallery view
Background processing for encryption/decryption of large files



Assumptions

The application is meant to be deployed over HTTPS
A proper database backup strategy will be implemented
The system will be kept updated with security patches
The server environment will be properly hardened
Access to server and database will be restricted and secured
